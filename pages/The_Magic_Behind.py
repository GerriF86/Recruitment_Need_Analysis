        **Empowering Innovation with Technology**

        At the core of our Recruitment Need Analysis App is a blend of cutting-edge technologies designed to ensure precise and efficient recruitment processes:

        ### The Backbone of the App
        - **Local operating Large Language Model:** Trained on millions of job-related data points, our large language model understands the nuances of job descriptions, organizational needs, and industry-specific terminology. Imagine an expert recruiter who has read millions of job postingsâ€”this is the depth of understanding Llama provides.
        
        - **Dynamic Question Flow:** Our app uses a **state machine model** to guide users through a tailored question-and-answer process, adapting dynamically to responses.
        
        - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This feature ensures the app retrieves and uses the most relevant information, enhancing its context-awareness and precision.

        - **Graph Databases:** By leveraging **Neo4j**, we efficiently handle organizational hierarchies and relationships, enabling seamless role-specific questioning.

        ### The Data Behind the Model
        - **2 Million Job Descriptions**
        - **1.5 Million Recruitment Reviews**
        - **Thousands of Organizational Charts**
